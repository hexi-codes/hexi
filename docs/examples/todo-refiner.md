# Example: Todo Refiner

Path: `examples/todo_refiner`

## Pattern

CLI wrapper process delegates task execution to Hexi.

## Why use this pattern

- lowest integration effort,
- language-agnostic orchestration around Hexi,
- easy to drop into existing scripts.

## Run

```bash
cd examples/todo_refiner
python run.py "Refactor TODO comments into issue references"
```
