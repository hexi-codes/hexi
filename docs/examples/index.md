# Examples Overview

Hexi ships with three example projects in `examples/`.
Hexi also ships five native project templates in `templates/`.

## `todo_refiner`

A minimal wrapper around the `hexi` CLI. Best for immediate adoption.

## `embedded_step`

Direct Python embedding using `RunStepService`. Best for library-style integration.

## `policy_loop`

A human-gated multi-invocation flow. Best for iterative workflows without background services.
